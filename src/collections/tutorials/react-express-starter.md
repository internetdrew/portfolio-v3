## Why This Stack Matters

This is a great stack to build with for React ecosystem beginners and experts alike. One of the greatest advantages with building with this stack (as opposed to meta-frameworks like Next.js) is that there are no black-boxes.

When I say black-boxes, I'm referring to the many abstractions that are commonly made in meta-frameworks to make building things easier. But I think there are two fundamental issues that you can run into when building with these:

1. You get really deep into learning how the meta-framework works, not how the technology it's built on works.
2. If you're an early-stage programmer, meta-frameworks give you the advantage of speed, but that often comes at the price of depth of knowledge of how communication works between the front and backend of your code.

This stack gives you full control and transparency around all of your code, without any unknown abstractions. While it might take a little more work to initially set up, I think you'll find over time that it allows you to move exceptionally quick, especially as we start to introduce some battle-tested libraries and modules.

This stack is fun, lightweight, and fast.
