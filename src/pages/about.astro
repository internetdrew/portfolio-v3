        I love solving problems with creative solutions. It's been the thing
        that has made me such a valued contributor in many of the companies I
        have worked for.

        At the end of 2020, I decided that I want to be able to learn how to
        take an idea and build it into a product. So I picked up my first
        programming book (<a

          _blank"

          ">Python Crash Course</a

        As someone who is nostalgic of the old days of the internet (<a

          class="underline underline-offset-2"
          >love the sound of AOL dial-up
        </a>), I decided that I wanted to build cool, valuable things on the
        internet. This led me from Python over to JavaScript.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Since then, I have enjoyed building products from my own ideas,
        expanding my knowledge of the modern internet and building quality
        software, as well as contributing to a few projects at YC-backed
        startup, <a
