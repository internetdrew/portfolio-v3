## What Happens Here

We will set up password-less signup and login flows. Weâ€™ll set things up so that:

- Users can signup for accounts with other necessary profile creation data (username, etc.) for your profiles table.
- Users can login with just their email address.
- Users cannot sign up at login.
- We automate a new user signup to create a new profile for us to access in our database in the public schema.
