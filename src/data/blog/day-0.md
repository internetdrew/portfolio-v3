## The Rundown

It's been two years since I've had a full-time job. I never thought it would be this hard to get things back on track. While I've had a few contracts, am in the process of helping build a product for demo, and have some cool projects in the works with some great people, it feels as though nothing has changed.

The stress of this has made me a less responsive son, friend, and father. And the more time that goes by, the worse things get.

Most days, I want to break. Especially of late. But I can't.

Going through this has impacted my mental health in ways I'm sure I won't understand until I have a chance to breathe and look in the rear view at this moment in time.

While the future feels bleak, it's also whatever you choose to make it.

Up until now, I've tried all of the best practices and did all of the things I "should" be doing. I've applied to countless jobs, continually network, let people know how passionate I am about what I do, tailored resumes, fought through the pain that is writing a cover letter, and more. And so far, it's been some generic rejections, some interviews that seemingly went well that ultimately went nowhere, and more than anything else, radio silence.

The good news is that now that I've done that and it hasn't worked, it's time to pivot and try something new, which is actually something old for me: **share my stuff and processes with the internet**.

## Why I'm Writing This

Every great comeback story starts with a single moment of choice to become something bigger and badder than you've ever been.

There are a ton of people who are where I am or will find themselves where I am if they continue to suffer in silence. And suffering in that silence — thinking you're all alone in the dark — actually keeps you from coming to that moment because you look at what's not working instead of the possibilities of reinventing yourself. You clam up. You think everything has to be THE thing.

But the reality is that the magic was always just YOU. You need to put more of you into the world. And you can do the same thing other people are doing, but your perspective on it matters more than you understand.

By writing this, I hope to give others a sigh of relief that they aren't alone. And I also want them to stop locking up and feeling sad for themselves and take a leap of faith and trust in themselves, the universe, and that adventure is something you have to attract through output.

You can't change your life by hiding from your reality. You need to lean all the way in on it.

I've spent the last decade of my life slowly dwindling my expressiveness and the perspective I share with the world down to nothing trying to fit in. I've held back my opinions. Shared less because I was afraid to look like I wasn't as seasoned or intelligent as others. I've held projects too closely because they needed to be "perfect" before I share them. I've chosen projects I don't care about simply because I think they'll impress others.

I let the fear of looking bad in front of people stifle me. And today, it all stops.

## A Marketing Problem

At the end of 2021, I bought myself a Python book for Christmas to teach myself how to program. It was the super power that was missing from my life stack. That's when the journey began to transition from marketer to programmer.

Breaking into the industry has been exceptionally hard, especially if you go the traditional route, because all of the advice that used to work no longer does. The bar is much higher, the competition is much tougher, and no one wants to hire anyone who they don't feel like they poached from some big company, it seems.

So what the hell are you supposed to do in a world where you can't just make up 5 years of experience out of nowhere?

I think the first step is to accept that fact. I think the next step is to completely disregard it and build something you care about, not something you think will be technically difficult (don't worry, complexity will _find you_). Do it fast. Do it loud. Make it available.

Because here's the thing: **when it comes to finding opportunities, most of your problems are marketing problems**.

Almost all of my opportunities in life that were out of the norm — the things that you look back and go, yeah, that was cool — have all been things people brought me in on because they saw I was working on something fun.

Here are some things I'm keeping in mind as I move forward:

- There is always someone with more skills than you. This sounds like it sucks but also...
- People like working with people they like. Get to know more people. Add value where you can. People will like you.
- People like working with people who find problems and proactively solve them. Find a problem, share why and how you're trying to solve it, see what happens.
- Your unique perspective and experiences are your greatest assets. Use them. Share your stories.
- Every project you share is a chance to connect with someone new. Make things. Share them.
- The internet rewards those who consistently show up and share their journey. Stop hiding away for days at a time. Go outside and play, physically and digitally.

Again, there will always be people more skilled than you. But you'd be surprised at how many people will take a chance on you just because they see your enthusiasm and care about [insert something you care about here].

If you can acknowledge that and know that you have value to add to others, whether that be businesses or personal, then it might be helpful to think of the gap between where you are and where you want to be as a marketing problem.

I have a marketing problem.

I've yet to work anywhere where I didn't immediately have an impact, make people feel better about the work, and help them become more productive. I did it as a dish washer at a restaurant. I did it as a marketer in both DTC and B2B.

Nowadays, I have two spaces I really care about: **building software and driving content initiatives**.

I'm going to use the spirit of the adages to dress for the job you want and to do the job to get the job, to market myself for the job I want by building things I actually care about, in public.

## What Happens Now

Now, you get to watch me bring _Where's the Garlic?!_ into new life as the OS for people who live and cook together, and love keeping that part of their lives organized.

I'll be working on this like a solo founder, sharing the idea from scratch, reimagining the interface, and sharing each piece of the product as it comes to life.

Wish me luck. I'll need it. So I'll be out there attracting it.

_P.S. Before I hit publish on this, I had a great call someone who wants to build something pretty awesome. The catalyst for the call? They thought my marketing and development skills were an interesting, hard-to-come-by combination. We'll see how it goes. See you on the other side!_
