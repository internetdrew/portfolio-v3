## The What? Why?

I'm building _Where's the Garlic?!_, the (I say this like it's going to change the course of human evolution) home kitchen management app for organized foodies to solve two distinct pain points for my partner and I:

1. We would constantly make it to the grocery store, then she turns to ask me how we are on [insert grocery item here] and I'd be like [image confused face and "idk" arms up].

2. We have many of our favorite recipes and we cook a lot for others. We sometimes have trouble tracking and sharing recipes with family and friends.

As someone mildly organized in a relationship with someone who is wildly organized, I figured I'd have fun building an app that keeps us organized with ease.

There will be many challenges along the way, I'm sure, but I really want to build this in public, help others stay organized, and see where the adventure leads.

## Why I'm Writing This

I'm writing this to document the journey and the challenges along the way to take others on the ride of going from idea to product. I'm building in public.

As a marketer and a software developer, I feel like I strike that sweet point between the technical and non-technical. So I want this to be a space where someone who doesn't know how to build software but just has a curiosity can follow the logic and process without getting bogged down in jargon.

I like to keep things simple and effective. Complications, to me, are usually a bi-product of a lack of understanding, not a feature.

I'll be continually updating this post as the app grows and the journey goes.

Thanks for taking the ride with me. Here we go.
