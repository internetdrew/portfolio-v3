## Table of Contents

tRPC has been one of my favorite additions to my preferred stack. But getting it to work can be a bit confusing based on the structure of the docs. It can be a bit chaotic and confusing.

I'm writing this for others to be able to easily get started and avoid some of the confusing bits of going back and forth through the docs, as there are some simple nuances that you can easily miss that have burned hours of my time. So I'm writing this so someone can easily walk through this process to get things up and running.

The table of contents is clickable, so feel free to skip to a part you need if you've already got something I'm covering here.

## What We're Using

- [Vite-based React](https://vite.dev/guide/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)

Let's get started.

## Creating the Stack

### Prerequisites

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (stick with LTS for this, through whatever Node Version Manager you use)

**Note:** Vite's latest needs a Node version greater than `20.19.0` or greater than/equal to `22.12.0` at the time of writing this.

### Setting Up the Frontend

To get started, let's get our Vite-based React front-end going. If you're thinking, _"What about create-react-app?"_, you can [learn more here](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app).

### Building the Front-end

In the root of the project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest .
```

When prompted to select a framework, choose `React` and then either TypeScript or (what I choose) TypeScript + [SWC](https://swc.rs/).

Now you just need to install deps with and bring the dev server up:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

You should now be able to see your initial app up at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)

### Building the Back-end

Let's create a separate directory for our backend and set up its dependencies:

```bash
mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y
npm install express cors dotenv
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/express @types/cors @types/node tsx nodemon
```

This keeps our frontend and backend dependencies separate, which is important for:

- **Security**: Backend-only packages don't get bundled with frontend
- **Build process**: Frontend and backend have different build steps
- **Development**: Easier to run frontend dev server and backend API separately
- **Dependency management**: Avoid version conflicts between frontend and backend packages

Even though we'll deploy this as a single full-stack application, keeping dependencies separate makes the build and development process much cleaner.

Now let's set up TypeScript configuration. Create `server/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["ES2020"],
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

Now let's create our basic Express server:

```bash
# Create the source directory and main server file
mkdir server/src
touch server/src/index.ts
```

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";
import cors from "cors";

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

// Basic health check route
app.get("/api/health", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json({ status: "ok", message: "Server is running!" });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Let's also set up the package.json scripts. Update `server/package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon --exec tsx src/index.ts"
  }
}
```

Create `server/nodemon.json` for better development experience:

```json
{
  "watch": ["src"],
  "ext": "ts",
  "ignore": ["src/**/*.spec.ts"],
  "exec": "tsx ./src/index.ts"
}
```

Now let's update the root `package.json` to add scripts that run both servers. Add these scripts to your root `package.json`. With `concurrently`, we're able to name our terminal output and color code them for easy debugging as we bring them up together.

First, let's install `concurrently`:

```bash
cd ..
npm install --save-dev concurrently
```

Then add our scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently -n \"client,server\" -c \"blue,green\" \"npm run dev:frontend\" \"npm run dev:backend\"",
    "dev:frontend": "vite",
    "dev:backend": "cd server && npm run dev",
    "build": "npm run build:frontend && npm run build:backend",
    "build:frontend": "vite build",
    "build:backend": "cd server && npm run build"
  }
}
```

Now you can start both servers with one command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:

- **Frontend** at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Backend** at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should see your client output in blue and your server output in green.

You can test the backend health endpoint at [http://localhost:3000/api/health](http://localhost:3000/api/health).

We now have:

- **Type safety** in the front- and back-end which allows...
  - **Better IDE support** with autocomplete and error detection
  - **Easier refactoring** with confidence
  - **Shared types** that can be used across frontend and backend

Now that we have our stack up and running, it's time to connect them both with tRPC so we get type-safety within our queries/mutations. 

This will allow us to easily know we are passing the right things to the back-end from the front-end and getting back from the backend what we expect on the front-end. Make a mistake? Your IDE will warn you.

## Connecting the Stack with tRPC for End-to-End Type-Safety

### Server Setup

First, let's install what we need for both the server and the client.

In the `server` directory:

```bash
npm i @trpc/server
```

We can then make a file for our tRPC router:

```bash
touch server/src/trpc.ts
```

```typescript
import { initTRPC } from "@trpc/server";

export const createContext = async () => {
  return {};
};

type Context = Awaited<ReturnType<typeof createContext>>;

/**
 * Initialization of tRPC backend
 * Should be done only once per backend!
 */
const t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create();

/**
 * Export reusable router and procedure helpers
 * that can be used throughout the router
 */
export const router = t.router;
export const publicProcedure = t.procedure;
```

Then in our `server/src/index.ts` file where our Express instance lives:

```typescript
import z from "zod";
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";
import { createExpressMiddleware } from "@trpc/server/adapters/express";
import cors from "cors";
import { router, createContext, publicProcedure } from "./trpc";


const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

export const appRouter = router({
  sayHello: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({ name: z.string() }))
    .query(async ({ input }) => {
      return `hello ${input.name}`;
    }),
});

const corsOptions = {
  origin: "http://localhost:5173",
  credentials: true,
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
app.use(express.json());

app.get("/api/health", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json({ status: "ok", message: "Server is running!" });
});

app.use(
  "/trpc",
  createExpressMiddleware({
    router: appRouter,
    createContext,
    onError: ({ error }) => {
      console.error(error);
    },
  }),
);

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

export default app;

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

This is essentially all you need for the basic tRPC server setup. Now let's reach for our query from the front-end.

### Client Setup

You can decide on this via the tRPC docs, but I use [their approach with TanStack Query](https://trpc.io/docs/client/tanstack-react-query/setup).

First, let's install the dependencies we need:

```bash
npm i @trpc/client @trpc/tanstack-react-query @tanstack/react-query
```

Then make our client-side tRPC file:

```bash
touch src/trpc.ts
```

And in there:

```typescript
import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { createTRPCOptionsProxy } from "@trpc/tanstack-react-query";
import type { AppRouter } from "../server/src/index";
import { createTRPCClient, httpBatchLink } from "@trpc/client";

export const queryClient = new QueryClient();

// Docs say localhost:3000 but I like to use server proxy with vite to bring things together seamlessly.
const trpcClient = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({
  links: [httpBatchLink({ url: "/trpc" })],
});

export const api = createTRPCOptionsProxy<AppRouter>({
  client: trpcClient,
  queryClient,
});
```

**Warning:** In this next code snipped, we're doing it this way because we are building an SPA so we need the singleton approach. If you're using an SSR framework, you'll need to [follow this path](https://trpc.io/docs/client/tanstack-react-query/setup#3a-setup-the-trpc-context-provider).

Now, we need to wrap our app with the query client provider. In `main.tsx`:

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import { queryClient } from "./trpc";
import { QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

Next we give Vite the server proxy to send calls for `/trpc` to `localhost:3000`. So in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/trpc": { // We defined this path in our client-side src/trpc.ts file
        target: "http://localhost:3000",
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

And now in `App.tsx`:

```typescript
import './App.css';
import { api } from './trpc';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery(api.sayHello.queryOptions({ name: 'John Wick' }));

  return (
    <>
      <p>{data}</p>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

If you look at your monitor, you should now see "Hello John Wick". Go ahead and change it and see it update. You now have end-to-end type-safety.
